Combining session-based and JWT-based authentication in one project is possible, 
but it's usually best to choose one based on your specific needs.
 Here’s a breakdown of each approach and factors to consider when deciding:

When to Use Session-Based Authentication---->>>

Server-side applications: It’s common in traditional web applications where user data is
 stored on the server.
 
Stateful: Sessions keep user information stored on the server, 
typically using cookies to track the session ID.
Automatic invalidation: Sessions can easily expire or be invalidated on logout.


When to Use JWT-Based Authentication-->>

API-first or Single Page Applications (SPA): JWTs are stateless and ideal for APIs or 
applications where users access resources without the server keeping user state.

Scalability: JWTs don’t require server memory for session storage, making them more scalable.

Stateless: JWTs don’t require server-side storage, allowing for easier horizontal scaling.

Security: JWTs are self-contained, so they must be secured well, 
as they can’t be invalidated until they expire.

Pros and Cons of Using Both---->>>

Pros--->>
Flexibility: You can cater to both web and API clients differently, e.g., 
using sessions for web clients and JWTs for APIs.
Hybrid applications: It allows web-based applications to handle some endpoints
 as stateful (sessions) and others as stateless (JWTs).
 
 
Cons--->>
Increased complexity: Managing two types of authentication can make the project more complex.

Security risks: Two types of auth increase the attack surface and need robust protection.
Inconsistencies: Users might face unexpected behavior if switching between session and
 JWT-based flows.
 
 
Recommendations--->>>

Use sessions for traditional web apps or applications where server-side session handling is 
beneficial.

Use JWTs for API-first applications or SPAs that primarily interact with backend services
 via REST or GraphQL.
 
If combining them, keep a clear separation of routes where sessions and JWTs apply, to avoid overlap.
In most cases, it’s simpler and more effective to choose one approach based on your app’s needs.
