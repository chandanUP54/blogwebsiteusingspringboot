Enum Naming Convention:-->>> In Spring Security, role names typically use the ROLE_ prefix.
 If RoleName is being used with hasRole("ROLE_ADMIN") in the security configuration,
  this prefix is necessary. Youâ€™re using ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_USER, and ROLE_REGULAR 
  as enum values, which aligns well.

Authorization Configuration:--->> When using hasRole, 
remember that Spring Security automatically adds the ROLE_ prefix when 
checking roles. So, if you set roles as ROLE_ADMIN in your enum,
 you can just use .hasRole("ADMIN") in your security configuration without adding 
 the ROLE_ prefix there.
